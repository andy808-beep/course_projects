# ðŸ“š Course Projects

This repository showcases selected projects from my coursework at **Boston University**, where I double-majored in **Economics** and **Environmental Analysis & Policy**.  
It includes analytical projects in **data science, forecasting, optimization, and policy analysis**, implemented in **R and Python**.

The goal of this repo is to provide a transparent record of my academic and technical work, and serve as a portfolio for future research and career opportunities.
